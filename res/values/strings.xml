    <string name="eui_description">Energy Utilization Index (EUI) is expressed as energy per square foot per year. It’s calculated by dividing the total energy consumed by the building in one year (measured in kBtu or GJ) by the total gross floor area of the building. It is most commonly used for commercial and industrial buildings so the building’s energy managers can see how they stack up against national averages regardless of the size of the building.\n\nFor example, a university’s energy manager could check its EUI against all other schools’ EUIs and see how well it compares. We wanted to use that method for residential homes. The only difference between our method and the industry used method is we divide the EUI by the number of people living in the home. This puts a family of 5 on a level playing field with a family of 2.\n\nNow the only difference between your EUI and your neighbour’s is the construction of your home, and your energy behaviours. The lower your EUI score the more energy efficient you are.  The ultimate goal is to have a net-zero energy home. That means your EUI is equal to 0.\n\nSo go ahead challenge your family and friends to see who has a lower score by the end of the month.</string>
