    <string name="eui_description">Energy Utilization Index (EUI) is expressed as energy per square foot per year. It’s calculated by dividing the total energy consumed by the building in one year (measured in kBtu or GJ) by the total gross floor area of the building. It is most commonly used for commercial and industrial buildings so the building’s energy managers can see how they stack up against national averages regardless of the size of the building.\n\nFor example, a university’s energy manager could check its EUI against all other schools’ EUIs and see how well it compares. We wanted to use that method for residential homes. The only difference between our method and the industry used method is we divide the EUI by the number of people living in the home. This puts a family of 5 on a level playing field with a family of 2.\n\nNow the only difference between your EUI and your neighbour’s is the construction of your home, and your energy behaviours. The lower your EUI score the more energy efficient you are.  The ultimate goal is to have a net-zero energy home. That means your EUI is equal to 0.\n\nSo go ahead challenge your family and friends to see who has a lower score by the end of the month.</string>

    <string name="whyMeterTextView_text">Why should I read my meter?</string>
    <string name="whyMeterDescription_text">Reading your electrical meter is easy to do and can help you manage your electricity bills. The readings you get will measure in kilowatt-hours (kWh). Your power company charges you based on how many kWh you use in a monthly billing period. Our research has shown that a month is too long for customers to go without seeing how much electricity they are using.\n\nImagine going to the grocery store and there are no prices listed anywhere. You put whatever you want in the cart and just walk outside with them without paying. After a month of doing this, the grocery store sends you a bill for all the groceries you took in the last thirty days.\n\nSounds crazy, right?\n\nWell, this is exactly how the power company is setup to bill you for your energy usage. Being able to read your meter once a week will allow you to manage your energy bills by giving you the power to tweak how much energy you’re using before the bill comes in. You never know, by the end of the month it might even help you find mistakes your power company has made by accidentally overbilling you.</string>
